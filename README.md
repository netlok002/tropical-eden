Subnautica-themed project to help new divers explore the depths with ease.

Subnautica is an open world survival action-adventure video game developed and published by Unknown Worlds Entertainment. In it, players are free to explore the ocean on an alien planet, known as planet 4546B, after their spaceship, the Aurora, crashes on the planet's surface. The player must collect resources and face creatures to survive.

This project is for seasoned players that are looking to increase the efficacy of their exploration. The goal is to enable players by giving them a 'recipe book' or 'list of ingredients' that they can use to calcuate just how many ingredients they will need to collect to 'fabricate' their desired item. 

The world of Subnautica is split into several biomes, each containing different types of ingredients and creatures. Navigating these biomes, depending on the distance away from the starting area, often requires special planning and preperation. This guide should serve as an assistant in making such preperations. It should also serve as an early indication of how many trips a user might need to take to gather all required ingredients, as well as an oracle of any foreseeable impediments (for example, an ingredient only being found in a biome that you do not currently have access to due to the depth)

It should be noted that this field guide is *not* for new players. Discovery is a key gameplay component of Subnautica and this list would spoil a great number of exciting game reveals. This should be taken into account before the project is live to users.
